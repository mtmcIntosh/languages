INTRO

" The best programmers are up to 28 times more productive than the worst! " 

- if you find an error, keep looking. 80% of error in 20% of the code.
- to learn to be a great programmer, write programs and study great programs others have written.
- for every 20% increase in the problem complexity, there is 100% increase in solution complexity
- the two biggest causes of project failure are poor estimation and unstable requirements
-development teams do not benefit from existing experience, they repeat mistakes 

PARANOIA MAKES US PRODUCTIVE
	IMPROVING QUALITY IMPROVES PRODUCTIVITY
	THINK BEFORE YOU CODE - UNDERSTAND REQUIREMENTS
	VALIDATE
	REVIEW    - peer review
	AUTOMATE




"All work and no playâ€¦"
	greatest productivity occurs in the first four to six hours
	continuous work reduces cognitive function 25%
	for every 24 hr

GIT

git init - initialize empty git repository
git add <file>  - interested in this  file to be trackedrepository
git commit  -  commits changes to repository (-m for version message)

git log - view history of changes

git diff - difference betwween file  inrepository and current directory

git status - summary of changes, if  no changes have been made, noth 2commit

git config --global <color.diff auto>  
git config --gloabl <core.editor vi>


after creating repository on github..
git remote add origin https://github.com/csgorham/repos-CSG.git
git push -u origin master
  
git clone https://github.com/.........    to download and clone rep
edit
add
commit
push


once changes from collaborators have been made
git pull        - bring in changes

git branch <>      - to create branch

git checkout <>     - to checkout branch
git checkout -b <>     - creates and checks out branch

git merge <branch>   - to merge branch (needs to be in master) 
git branch -d <>      - to delete branch 

git branch === lets you know what branches exist

SQL

SELECT cols, cols, cols   (DISTINCT option) 
SELECT col, col COUNT(*) [returns #of rows matching], AVG(col), SUM(col)
FROM database
ORDER BY column DESC or ASC
WHERE col>=val AND col IS NOT NULL       (IS NOT NULL has to be before GROUP BY)
GROUP BY col, col

INSERT INTO database VALUES ('',NULL, '','')
DELETE FROM databases WHERE col='value'

CREATE table AS 	- to create 
SELECT *FROM database
WHERE ......

DROP table		- to delete

Joining tables together

SELECT d.col, c.col, c.col
FROM database1 d
JOIN catabase2 c
ON database1.col = database2.col

string concatonation
SELECT d.col, (d.col1 || " " d.col2) as keyword
FROM database d
JOIN database2 s
ON keyword = d.col 


SELECT s., ROUND((AVG()-m.mass)/m.mass,2) as difference  [2 for decimal places]
ORDER BY ABS(difference) DESC
