Energy is the direct function of the exact position of all atoms and forces on the atoms

force field, potential force
intra molecular 
	-bond length
	-bond angle
	-torsion angle

inter/intra molecular
	-coulomb interactions
	-van der waals

V_t=V_r+V_theta+V_phi +V_c+V_vDW

Monte Carlo
	- incorporation of thermodynamics
	- dynamic progression through time
	
DIFFERENT WAYS IN WHICH PARTICLES DEFINE THE SYSTEM:
cononical - constant parameters, what is the other parameter (lowest energy configuration) ensure the thermodynamic properties are obeyed
grand cononical - number of particles are allowed to change 
configurationally biased MCsimulation, must correct for ignored configurations
Gibbs ensemble MCsimulation

MD - how things change with time
Newton's laws of motion
force is the derivative of potential energy 
~~groteous method

SIMULATION OF KINETIC PROCESSES

deterministic
	-averaging rate equations
	-dC/dt = -k * C_a

stochastic kinetics
	-probablilty that system moves from one state to the next
	-concentration*rate_constant
	**must hold detailed balance

	-Master Equation(probability that system moves fom one state to the next)
		-optimize system to 
		-analytical solution (can only be solved for few systems)
		-numerical soludtion (dynamic/kinetic MCS)

	**** extension of eq. methods -Metropolis methos- 1953
	****Beeler - 1966 Radiation Damage
	**** Algorithm develoment: 1. 1975 Bortz, Kalos, Lebowitx (BKL) - surfaces (physics)
				   2. 1976 Gillespie = well mixed systems

	Dynamic (kinetic) MC sim
		-fixed time step (time space)
			probability that A reacts to B  -- P_ab = 1-exp(-k_ab * dt)
			**drawbacks for fixed time, multistep processes are not allowed to 
			  continue to react within the time step 
			~ know all of the time steps and pathways before interaction, (i.e. equilibrium probability)
			~ lim t --> 0 
		- variable time step (event space)
			- choice of k is ultimately important, allows you to take smaller-smaller timescales into consideration
			-define kinetics
			- structure - process input ( T, P, V, initial position, etc) and kinetic input ** calculate transition probabilities (k_i) -- compute total rate, compute time (dt=-(ln(RN))/sum(k)), compute event, update surface, iterate to compute total rate
			~sim proceed in event space therefore the system on average moves at fast time scales, always watching the fast 
movement but wish to watch the slow event therefore longer total sim times are needed
			
			-approaches, null event ( some moves some do not move (grain boundary, stuck) ) 
				-randomly pick site
				-calculate rate at site
				-normalize rates
				-select a process or null event
				-execute event
				-update time and repeat

SIMULATING SURFACE KINETICS
	** how things adsorb, reaction with surface

	-leap frog approach, skip over fast and time consuming events after equilibratied
