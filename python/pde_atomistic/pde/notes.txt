dx is gridzone
numerical error acts like a viscosity
timesteps updated as needed, time is not a matrix ; Euler/backwards Euler 

explicit method: calculate the state of a system at a later time from the state of the system at the current time
implicit method: find a solution by solving an eqn involving both the current state of the system and the later one

HYPERBOLIC_PDE
	waves of one form or another : advection is hyperbolic
	superposition of waves can lead to dispersion, dissipation (dv dAmp)
	transmits discontinuities
	compressible fluids (may have shocks)
	-FTCS is unconditionally unstable; therefore use CTCS (centered time, ce	ntered space)

   CTCS 
	conditions: 
		dt=dx/(Tg/w)^.5 , equality
   leap frog: needs artificial viscosity, used for incompressible flow
	

ELLIPTIC
	could write the solution as fourier waves

ALIASING
	source of error due to discretization
	higher unresolved wavelengths can not always be distinguished from lower	   ~~nonlinear interactions can cause power to reflect, method becomes unst	      able
